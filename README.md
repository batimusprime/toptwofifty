This app scrapes the IMDB website and returns the top 250 movies as a checklist for watching

scrape.py initially operates off of static "source.html"

index.html lists static display of movies with non-functioning checkbox
#TO-DO:
System flow documentation and charts
Integrate cloud storage via Firebase
Integrate method in which to mark movies as watched
Integrate storage for individual users via Firebase Auth
Host on firebase

# Future Plans
Include links to IMDB page
Pre load / display preview on hover / side pane
